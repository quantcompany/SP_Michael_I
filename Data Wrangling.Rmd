library(dplyr)
```

Transforming into a table data frame

```{r}
nba <- tbl_df(nba)

```


How many times has each team gone to the playoffs?
```{r}
nba <- tbl_df(nba)

select(nba, Team, Playoffs) %>% group_by(Team) %>%
    summarise(times_in_playoffs = sum(Playoffs)) %>%
    arrange(desc(times_in_playoffs))

```

For each season, which team had the largest difference in points?

```{r}

select(nba, SeasonEnd, Team, PTS, oppPTS) %>% 
    mutate(difference = PTS - oppPTS) %>% 
    group_by(SeasonEnd) %>% 
    summarise(
        Team = Team[which.max(difference)], 
        LargestDiff = max(difference))

```
